			b. If the folder doesn’t exist. Run “sudo apt-get update” to update the application list.
			c. Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl3” to install the libcurl3.
			d. Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev” to install the development API of libcurl4.
		-Use "make" command for building the program
		-Use "make clean" command for dissambling the program
